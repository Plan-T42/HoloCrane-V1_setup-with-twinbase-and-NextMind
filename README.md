## HoloCrane Twinbase and NextMind Setup


This project is a development extension from the [HoloCrane project](https://github.com/Plan-T42/HoloCrane), which is a mixed reality interface running on Microsoft HoloLens 1 device for a digital twin based crane opeation.
The setups of the following two modules are currently being investigated in this project: 
 
1. The mixed reality application accessing the DT documents using [twinbase](https://github.com/twinbase/twinbase)

2. Integrating mind-controlled interaction into the mixed reality application using [NextMind DevKit](https://www.next-mind.com/documentation)
